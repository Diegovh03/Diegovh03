Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Diego Valdivia, an Environmental Engineer with over 5 years of experience in the energy, mining, and metallurgical sectors. I've extensively utilized various software and tools for environmental analysis and modeling across diverse scenarios, including ArcGIS, Terrset, Aermod, among others. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to channel my expertise and knowledge into a Ph.D. opportunity focusing on environmental analysis, environmental impacts, or model development.

I recently embarked on enhancing my skills in data analysis using Python for modeling purposes. I'm eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in environmental science and make a positive impact on sustainability initiatives.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring opportunities in Ph.D. programs, particularly those aligned with my interests in environmental analysis and modeling.
ðŸŒ± I'm continuously learning and honing my skills in Python to enhance my capabilities in data-driven environmental research.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration and eager to engage in impactful projects that contribute to advancements in environmental science.

Feel free to reach out at diego.valdiviah@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities. Looking forward to connecting with you!

Best regards,
