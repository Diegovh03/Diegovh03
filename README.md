# Introduction 

👋 Hi there! I'm Diego Valdivia

I'm an Environmental Engineer with over 5 years of professional experience in environmental management across the energy, metallurgical, and industrial sectors. Over the past few years, I have specialized in applying **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** and **Material Flow Analysis (MFA)** to evaluate the environmental performance of technologies and resource flows, especially within battery and recycling systems.

## 🔍 My Focus

- 🔋 LCA and MFA for battery technologies (lead-acid, emerging storage systems)
- 🌱 Sustainability assessment of industrial and circular systems
- 🛠️ Implementation of ISO 14040/44 frameworks in real operations
- 📊 Environmental modeling and scenario analysis using Python
- 🛰️ GIS-integrated approaches for spatial and temporal impact tracking

## 🛠 Tools & Skills

- **LCA Tools**: SimaPro, openLCA, Brightway2 (currently learning)  
- **MFA Tools**: STAN  
- **Programming & Data Analysis**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
- **GIS & Spatial Analysis**: QGIS, ArcGIS, TerrSet  
- **Other**: AERMOD, Microsoft Excel, AutoCAD

## 📚 Projects & Research

### 🎓 Master's Thesis – “Towards Sustainable Recycling: A Comprehensive Life Cycle and Material Flow Analysis of Lead-Acid Battery Recycling Processes”
KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. Combined LCA (SimaPro) and MFA (STAN) to assess the trade-offs in environmental performance of industrial battery recycling systems.

### 💧 Comparative LCA of Water Treatment Technologies – Norvatten (Sweden)
Developed during the LCA course (AL2181) at KTH. Modeled two treatment scenarios using SimaPro and performed sensitivity analysis on key environmental impact categories.

### 🌍 Geospatial Environmental Research – Stockholm University
Contributed to a global project (in collaboration with Stanford and UC Berkeley) involving the processing of historical aerial imagery to map urban expansion and land use change over time.

### 🧮 Environmental Modeling – Personal Exploration in Python
As part of my growing interest in open-source and dynamic LCA tools, I’ve been exploring environmental modeling using Python. This includes developing basic simulations in Jupyter Notebooks—for CO₂ emissions estimation, water quality analysis, and air quality prediction—to strengthen my data skills and systems thinking.

I am currently learning **Brightway2** to build more flexible and dynamic LCA models that integrate better with Python-based workflows and allow scenario-based analysis of evolving technologies such as energy storage systems.

## 🎯 Current Goals

I’m currently advancing my skills in **Brightway2** and **dynamic sustainability modeling**, integrating LCA with Python and geospatial tools to evaluate material systems such as energy storage technologies under evolving scenarios.
